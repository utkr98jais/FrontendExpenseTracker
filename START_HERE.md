## 🔑 Key Concepts

### What's Built

- **4 React Components** - Dashboard, Categories, Forms
- **1 Custom Hook** - Easy state access
- **1 Context Provider** - Global state management
- **Drag & Drop** - Professional UI interactions
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile to desktop

### How It Works

1. User opens app → Dashboard loads with sample data
2. User creates category → New category appears
3. User adds expense → Appears under category
4. User drags item → Reorganizes as needed
5. User deletes item → Removes immediately
6. All totals → Update in real-time

### Where Everything Is

- **Components**: `src/components/`
- **State**: `src/context/ExpenseContext.jsx`
- **Hook**: `src/hooks/useExpense.js`
- **Main**: `src/App.jsx`, `src/main.jsx`
